## Parabolic-Solar-Tracker

The Parabolic Solar Tracker is an advanced solar tracking system that dynamically adjusts the position of a parabolic solar collector to maximize energy absorption by continuously facing the sun. Using a precise sun-position algorithm, the tracker calculates the sun's azimuth and elevation angles for any given geographic location and time, ensuring optimal alignment throughout the day.

# Key Features:

Sun-Position Algorithm: Computes real-time solar coordinates based on latitude, longitude, date, and time.

Automated Adjustment: Controls servo motors or actuators to reposition the parabolic reflector for maximum solar exposure.

Energy Efficiency: Enhances solar energy capture compared to fixed-position systems.

Geolocation Adaptability: Works for any geographic location with configurable inputs.

Open-Source & Scalable: Designed for integration with solar panels, concentrators, or thermal systems.

# Potential Applications:

Solar power plants

Concentrated solar thermal systems

Off-grid renewable energy solutions

Built with precision and sustainability in mind, this project aims to improve solar energy harvesting efficiency through intelligent automation.
